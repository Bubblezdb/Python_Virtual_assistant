# Description: I used a virtual assistant program created by following the "Build a Vitrual Assistant Using Python" tutorial. I modified it by changing the controls and scripting.

#pip install pyaudio

#pip install gTTS :  (Google Text-to-Speech), a Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translateâ€™s text-to-speech API. 
# Writes spoken mp3 data to a file, a file-like object (bytestring) for further audio manipulation, or stdout. 
#It features flexible pre-processing and tokenizing, as well as automatic retrieval of supported languages.
